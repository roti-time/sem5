Q1)

WPA2 uses AES encryption with a pre-shared key and 
it is vulnerable to offiline brute force attacks

WPA3 addresses this by implementing simultaneous
authentication of equals, basically replacing PSK with a 
secure exchange method.

forward secrecy ensures that if a session is compromised, the 
past communications are safe.
WPA3 also limits the number of incorrect login attempts.


Q2)

WEP was an early wifi securing mechanism and it used RC4 for
encryption and a short 24-bit initialization vector. these could be reused
and it gave attackers enough information to crack the WEP key, the fact that WEP's
integrity check was weak didn't help either.

WPA improved this by using TKIP (temporal key integrity protocol) which changed the
encryption key for each packet therefore, improving security.

WPA2 replaced RC4 with AES and it used CCMP for better data integrity checks which helped
in securing wifi.
